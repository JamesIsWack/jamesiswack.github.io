github user profile website :)

# Changes so far
- CSS is now loaded externally from a `css` instead of being inside the `html` documents
  - Todo
  - Add a HTML page for every repo I have, and include images/different styling ect
  - Make a PS3 resources site (this will take a LONG time, please contribute by giving me ideas or info on Discord: JamesIsWack#8330)
