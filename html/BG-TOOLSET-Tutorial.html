                First, go to <a href="bgtoolset.html">this page</a> in the PLAYSTATION 3's browser. This should be located under Network on the XMB (PS3s main interface). Open Internet Browser, and let it load. once done press START on the controller, and enter this <a href="https://furever.me/ps3/jamesiswack-bgtoolset/">URL.</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                nce you are in the toolset, it should load. If it doesn't, and asks to load the plugin, check "Do not display again" and answer "Yes". Navigate to Console Manager. Let it extract the contents of dev_flash, and when it is finished, scroll down until you see "Flash Memory Patch". Press X on it and select "Load Patch via HTTPS". Once it is done, click X on the Close button in the dialog. Now for the risky part. Go back to Flash Memory Patch, this time selecting "Apply Loaded Patch".

            <p>
                <p><FONT COLOR="red">AGREE TO THE DIALOG, AND CONTINUE. DO NOT POWER OFF THE CONSOLE OR EXIT THE WEB BROWSER DURING THIS PROCESS, DOING SO WILL CAUSE A IRECOVERABLE BRICK! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</FONT></p>
            </p>
            <p>
                Once it has finished patching, and tells you "Console can now be restarted", you can install CFW!
